# Carbon Balance Life Cycle Impact Assessment Method
This is a proof-of-concept tool to calculate the carbon balance of life cycle inventories using the automated life cycle impact assessment calculations in openLCA modeling software. A standardized set of elementary flows defined in the Federal LCA Commons Elementary Flows List (FEDEFL) is the foundation for this impact assessment category. Resource flows are indicated by positive values and emission flows by negative values, but the impact category itself is non-directional.

This repository consists of several files, including an Excel file with the carbon content calculations performed, Excel files with the carbon contents of all resource, emission/air, emission/water, and emission/ground flows, and a PDF report of the methods, assumptions, and limitations of this approach.
